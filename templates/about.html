        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            We are a Georgia-Based company just outside of Atlanta. 
            Plant Therapy is a plant nursery that sells plants online 
            but also holds workshops in person to teach new plant owners 
            all about raising and taking care of plants. View our plant 
            collection online or stop in to join a workshop, shop for 
            supplies, or ask us a questionâ€”or several! We're here for
             all of your growing needs.
